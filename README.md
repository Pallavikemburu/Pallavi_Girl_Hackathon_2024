  Problem Statement :
     Adaptive Learning for Basic Education: Develop a virtual tutor platform that assesses the learner's understanding level at every step and curates relevant content to enhance the learning experience.

          

  Solution: The solution includes the 
     
  1. Assessment System:
   - Implement an initial assessment system that evaluates the learner's current understanding level in various basic education subjects such as mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies.
   - Use a combination of multiple-choice questions, short answers, and interactive tasks to gauge the learner's strengths and weaknesses.

  2. Data Analysis:
   - Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the assessment results and identify the learner's areas of proficiency and areas that need improvement.
   - Develop a personalized learning profile for each learner based on their assessment data, learning preferences, and goals.

  3. Curated Content:
   - Create a repository of educational content including lessons, quizzes, interactive simulations, videos, and games covering the basic education curriculum.
   - Tag each content item with metadata indicating its difficulty level, learning objectives, and relevance to specific topics or skills.

  4. Adaptive Learning Engine:
   - Build an adaptive learning engine that dynamically selects and presents content to the learner based on their current proficiency level and learning pace.
   - Utilize algorithms that adjust the difficulty of questions and activities based on the learner's performance, providing challenges without overwhelming or underwhelming them.


        

  SETUP OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENT :

  1. clone this repo
  2. to run this frontend and backend you need nodejs & flutter SDK in your system
  3. open this repo using vscode then you will get two folders
  	like this 
  		Backend
  		Frontend
  4. open terminal in vscode 
  	 cd Backend
  5. then run this commands
     npm i --legacy-peer-deps
  	 npm start
  6. open frontend to this path
  	 path--frontend/lib/utils/consts/app_urls.dart
  	 change the ip address in the urls with your system ip address
  7. Go to your frontend folder
  	 flutter pub get
  	 flutter run
  	 then select your emulator
  8. And now the App runs in Emulator.
